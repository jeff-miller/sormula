/**
 * Annotations for defining cascade relationships between two row classes. A cascade relationship
 * allows an operation on a source row to initiate operations on one or more target rows. For example,
 * use a cascade annotation on a parent row so that read/modification on parent row corresponds to
 * read/modify on child rows.
